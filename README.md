# Quantum
interactive visual particle system with advanced physics, inspired by quantum field simulations using the Barnes-Hut algorithm for gravitational approximation.

At first glance, it's just a JavaScript and HTML script, but at its core, it's an orchestra of particles, a microcosm of interactive physics that essentially simulates an emergent quantum field.

Each particle is born with its own position and velocity, like a lone star in a vacuum.
The Barnes-Hut algorithm acts like a conductor, bringing gravitational interactions together so that thousands of points dance in harmony without the performance falling apart.
They attract, repel, connect with translucent lines when they're close, and together, they create a dynamic tapestry that transforms as you move your mouse, an invisible hand shaping the chaos.

Entropy, energy, and average velocity aren't trivial numbers; they're the heartbeat of this miniature universe.
The dark background is the cosmos, and each luminous trail is a particle revealing its history of movement.
There's poetry in this calculated chaos: the code transforms cold mathematics into living art, where interaction, color, and physics meet.

In essence, this script shows that beauty is not just in the visual result, but in the architecture of the system.
